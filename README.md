## Backup or Clean Reddit Account

<hr>
<p>
	<strong>üåü Backup</strong>: With this functionality you can export all 
your subreddits. Sometimes you need a new account but want to keep all the subs you follow. Most of the time this is a boring job. 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>üßπ Clean </strong>: With this functionality you can remove all 
your activity for example delete all the comments you have done or all the posts you have created. People tell personal information that can lead to someone that knows them or recognize them. Lot of people say or posts things in Reddit that in person no one knows. (Actions can't be undone)
</p>

<p>
	<strong>üîÑ Confuse</strong>: Replace your comments and posts text (not 
title). This is helpful since deleted comments can still be viewed. 
Results look like screenshot at the end of page. Actions can't be undone in 
most cases unless Rollback functionality is activated with while confusing.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>‚è™ Rollback</strong>: If you changed your mind and you want to
return back the confused items to their original state, rollback can do 
this. <br>

<i>Disclaimer: Rollback still can fail due to varius reasons like removed
item, locked account etc.</i>

#### First you need to set the praw.ini file <br>

<ul>
<li>
	Rename the <strong>praw.ini.example</strong> to <strong>praw.ini</strong> after that create a Reddit app. In order to ask the Reddit for data you need an app so use the following link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/">https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/</a> 
</li>

<li>
Fill a name for the app. The type should be set to script and redirect uri http://localhost:8080 The script will be working locally, no worries for the uri. 
</li>

<li>
	After creating the app we need the credentials. <strong>client_id</strong> is right under the app name and <strong>client_secret</strong> is the secret key. 
</li>

<li>
Get credentials for old and new accounts.
